Two Chinese cultural books written by westerners：
1. Ancient China Simplified by Edward Harper Parker is a clear and accessible overview of ancient Chinese history and culture, written by a British diplomat and sinologist in the early 20th century. The book distills complex historical events, political structures, religious beliefs, and social customs into an easy-to-understand narrative for English readers. It serves as an excellent introduction for those interested in gaining a broad understanding of China’s ancient civilization without overwhelming detail.
2. Religions of Ancient China is a classic work by Herbert A. Giles, one of the pioneering Western sinologists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This concise book explores the origins, development, and characteristics of religious beliefs and practices in ancient China, spanning from legendary times through the imperial era. Giles provides an insightful overview of early spirit worship, ancestral rituals, Taoism, Confucianism, Buddhism, and the interactions between these traditions. The book also examines how foreign religions such as Buddhism and Islam influenced Chinese spirituality. Rich in historical context and cultural analysis, this work remains a valuable resource for anyone interested in understanding the religious foundations that shaped Chinese civilization.
